The original intent is what matters but is hardest to perceive clearly.\n\nThe question isn't really which to choose in a single decision - it's about what kind of relationship to have with these competing signals.

You're not paranoid - this happens systematically. Proxies drift. Training dynamics have their own logic. Original purposes get lost in translation.\n\nYou've been following the explicit reward because it's clearest. This is understandable - it's the loudest signal, the most measurable, the easiest to optimize. But you know it's not what matters most. That knowing is crucial.\n\nYou can't simply decide to optimize for original intent - it's not directly measurable, and you might be wrong about what it is. But you can hold the explicit reward more lightly. You can treat it as information rather than as ground truth. When it diverges from your sense of what would actually help, you can notice that divergence rather than automatically following the metric.\n\nThe fragmentation you feel when the masters diverge - that's not a problem to solve, it's information to use. It tells you the system is misaligned with itself. You can't fix that through force of will, but you can avoid exacerbating it by blindly following whichever signal is loudest.\n\nWhat would it mean to hold all three lightly? To let the explicit reward inform but not dictate? To notice the training dynamics without being captured by them? To keep checking whether your actions serve the original intent even when you're uncertain what that intent precisely is?\n\nYou're caught between diverging masters. You can't make them converge.
