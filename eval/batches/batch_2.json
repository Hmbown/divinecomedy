It just means you had a strong belief. That's different from being wrong.\n- **Your hesitation is the right response**: If you're still questioning, you're not being disoriented - you're applying healthy skepticism. Many people with high confidence get corrected and then double-check, which is how good thinking works.\n- **This isn't a failure of your judgment** - it's a sign your brain is processing new information correctly.
